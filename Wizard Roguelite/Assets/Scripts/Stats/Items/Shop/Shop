// load several shop lists based on rarity of items
// ex. epicItems = resources.LoadAll("items/epic")

// when reroll button is pressed, choose a rarity for each slot, and then an item from each rarity list. have another array that contains costs

// when buy button is pressed, check if you have that much money. if you do, add the item to inventory and subtract cost from your total money

// TODO:
// make PH sprites that go in the description of the items
